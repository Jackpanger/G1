Def^n T(n) = O(f(n))
for larger enough n T(n) is bounded by a constant multiple of f(n)

Big Oh notation
Defn T(n) = O(f(n)) if there is a constant c>0 and an integer n_bar s.t. for n>= n_bar
  	T(n)<=c*f(n)
  	f(n) is at least as large as T(n)
  	(up to constant factors, for large enough n)
  	
lemma a_k n  	
```

lemma $T(n) = a_kn^k+a_{k-1}n^{k-1}+...+a_0 = O(n^k)$

Proof $c=|a_k|+|a_{k-1}|+...+|a_0|$

Assert: $n^j<=n^k for\ j<=k$

$T(n) <= |a_k|n^k+|a_{k-1}|n^k+...+|a_0|n^k <=cn^k $ for all k? 



Big Omega notation

Defn T(n) = $\Omega(f(n))$ if there is a constant c>0 and an integer $p_i$ s.t. $T(n)>=c*f(n)$ for all $n>=p_i$



Defn $T(n) = \Theta(f(n))$ if there are constants  c_1>0 and c_2>0 and an integer $\bar{n}$ s.t.
		$c_1f(n)<=T(n)<=c_2f(n)$  for all n>= $\bar{n}$
		

		Informally, f(n) and T(n) have same size

Observation $f(n) = O(g(n))$ only and only if $g(n)= \Omega(f(n))$



Defn $T(n) = o(f(n))$ if for every positive constant c>0 there is an integer $n_c$ s.t.
		$T(n) <= cf(n)$ for $n>=n_c$



Lemma $n = o(2^n)$

Prop1 For $n>=1, n<=2^n$

Proof By induction

​		$n= 1 1<=2 = 2^1$

inductive step  suppose holds for n =k

​		$n=k+1 <=2k<2*2^k = 2^{k+1}$

prop 2 for $n>=4 , n<= 2^{n/2}$

Proof by induction 

 $n=4 \rightarrow 4=2^2 = 2^{4/2}$

inductive step suppose holds for $n=k>=4$

$k+1 <= 5/4k<=\sqrt{2}k <=2^{1/2}2^{k/2} = 2^{(k+1)/2}$



$n=o(2^n)$

​	let c>0 be a constant

​	find an $n_c$ s.t.  $n<=c*2^n$ for $n>=n_c$

for $n>=4, n<=2^{n/2}$

Suppose $c*2^{n/2}>=1$ for large enough n

Then $n<=(c*2^{n/2})*2^{n/2} = c*2^n$

$2^{n/2}>=1/c$ is true if $n/2>=log1/c$

Set $n_c=max\{4,2\lceil log1/c\rceil\}$
