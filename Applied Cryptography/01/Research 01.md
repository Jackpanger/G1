**1. Implement (coding in any programming language) the attacks described in this chapter for the shift cipher or the Vigenere cipher.**

Shift cipher:

```python
# Frequency of characters
pattens_list = [8.2, 1.5, 2.8, 4.3, 12.7, 2.2, 2, 6.1, 7,
                0.2, 0.8, 4, 2.4, 6.7, 1.5, 1.9, 0.1, 6.0,
                6.3, 9.1, 2.8, 1, 2.4, .2, 2, .1]


def attack(code: str):
    # Calculation: 0.06025
    code = code.lower()
    qh = sum([(i * 0.01) ** 2 for i in pattens_list])
    text_dict = dict.fromkeys(range(26), 0)
    for i in code:
        text_dict[(ord(i) - ord('a')) % 26] += 1
    result_list = []
    for i in range(26):
        # calculate I_j
        text_res = sum([(pattens_list[j] * 0.01) * (text_dict[(j + i) % 26] / len(code)) for j in text_dict.keys()])
        result_list.append(text_res)
    abs_min = min([abs(i - qh) for i in result_list])
    abs_dis = [abs(i - qh) for i in result_list]
    for i in range(len(abs_dis)):
        if abs_dis[i] == abs_min:
            shift = i
    # get the closest value
    result = ""
    for i in code:
        result += chr((ord(i) - ord('a') - shift) % 26 + ord('a'))
    return result


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_case = "Likhkdgdqbwklqjfrqilghqwldowrvdbkhzurwhlwlqflskhuwkdwlvebvrfkdqjlqjwkhrughuriwkhohwwhu"
    print(attack(test_case))
```

**2. Show that the shift, substitution, and VigenÃ¨re ciphers are all trivial to break using a chosen-plaintext attack. How much chosen plaintext is needed to recover the key for each of the ciphers?**

>**Shift:** 
>
>Only one pair of plaintext/ciphertext is needed for the recovery. For a plaintext $m=m_1\cdots m_l$ and ciphertext $c=c_1\cdots c_l$. $k$ can be deduced by the shift from any corresponding character $c_i$ to $m_i$. For example, $m =$ "abcd" and $c=$"bcde", the shift is the shift from $b$ to $a$, which equals to 1. This is trivial to break.
>
>**Substitution**:
>
>This need at least the number of characters plaintext. If we only consider 26 alphabet, then 26 plaintext/ciphertext pairs should be included to get the permutation map. Therefore, the map from plaintext to ciphertext is deduced by this attack. It is trivial to break by using chosen-plaintext attack.
>
>**Vigenere cipher:**
>
>At least one pair. If the pair of plaintext/ciphertext is long enough for the key(repeated), it is similar to shift cipher. For a plaintext $m=m_1\cdots m_l$, ciphertext $c=c_1\cdots c_l$ and key $k=k_1k_2\cdots k_tk_1k_2\cdots k_l$, then $k_i=c_i-m_i$ for $1\le i\le t$ and repeated for the remaining plaintext. If the length of the chosen pair is less than a key instance, it need more than one pair. Otherwise, one chosen pair is enough to recover the key.

**3. Does composing multiple substitution ciphers one after the other improve security than using a single substitution cipher?**

>No. Assume there is  a plaintext $m$, after a substitution, the text will become $s_1$ until $i$ times, then we have intermediate text $s_1, s_2\cdots s_{i-1}$, the final ciphertext is $c$. Actually, all of the substitution can be considered as one substitution from $m$ to $c$ without $s_i$. In essence, the key that defines the permutation from $m$ to $c$ has no much difference with other permutation like just from $m$ to $s_1$ in substitution cipher. Hence, it will not improve security and it still perform one substitution actually.
